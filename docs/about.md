### Q&A

##### Where does the ‘Trakt’ name come from?

It looks like ‘Trakt’ means ‘funnel’ in Norwegian ([source 1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trakt), [source 2](https://en.glosbe.com/nb/en/trakt)), and this tool acts like a type-level funnel, with this notion of convergence to a chosen single type, to express a common concept across various Coq inductive types.
